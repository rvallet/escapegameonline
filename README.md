# EscapeGameOnline
OpenClassRooms Exercise :
EscapeGame Online Project for Gameplay Studio (virtual company).

The goal of this game is to guess a combination of N numbers with a maximum of attempts. These elements are adjustable in the file game_settings.properties.

An indication is provided, after each attempt, in the form of a sequence of mathematical signs.

The '+' sign indicates that the figure to be found on this position is greater.

The '-' sign that the figure to be found is smaller.

The '=' sign indicates that you have the correct number on this position.

```
If the secret combination is '555' and the proposition is '950',
the indication provided by the computer or to provide will be '-=+'.
```
Three game modes:

Challenger Mode: The computer must guess your secret combination (note it before starting the game).

Defender mode: Try to guess the number chosen by the computer.

Duel Mode: Each player chooses his secret combination. The first to find it wins the round (unlimited number of attempts).
